## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Bonjour vous

I am a french student working at the school "[LA MACHE](https://www.ecolelamache.org)" and currently working at the "[IBCP](https://www.ibcp.fr/fr/landing-page-fr/)" where I am a "Superior Technician System and Network" < cool name for someone who is doing ticket half the time :|
 
I like working on linux server and using open-source software.

I Don't really have that much skills, I try to improve everything I get in touch of.

I have no idea of what I'm doing to be honest :/

Voila, Voila
